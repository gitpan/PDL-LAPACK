INSTALLATION
------------

Installing PDL::LAPACK requires an installed PDL package, which should 
include PDL::PP. PDL::PP is preprocessor which simplyfies the access
of PDL piddles from C.

Steps To Build:
1. if you don't have a global reachable CLAPACK installation (like me, 
   because i could find a clapack debian package), you need to compile 
   and install CLAPACK first. Have a look at 'COMPILING CLAPACK'.
2. edit Makefile.PL to match your system settings (name of liblapack.so, 
   include dir, etc.)
3. perl Makefile.PL 
4. make
5. make test
6. make install
7. have fun ...


COMPILING CLAPACK
-----------------
Download CLAPACK from http://www.netlib.org/clapack/.

Untar the package and configure make.inc before starting to build the
libraries.
Since the author uses a gnu/linux installation on i386 with gcc and 
wants to link against the atlas library, following variables in make.inc
needed to be changed:

PLAT      = _LINUX
CC        = gcc
CFLAGS    = -funroll-loops -O2 
LOADER    = gcc
LOADOPTS  = -O2 
NOOPT     = -O2
BLASLIB   = ../../libcblaswr.a -lcblas -latlas

Now copy following files into the LAPACK directory:

CLAPACK/blaswrap.h
CLAPACK/clapack.h
CLAPACK/f2c.h
CLAPACK/libF77.a
CLAPACK/libI77.a
CLAPACK/libcblaswr.a
CLAPACK/liblapack_LINUX.a
CLAPACK/tmglib_LINUX.a

The *_LINUX libraries may be named according to your architecture.
The lapack_LINUX.a should be renamed into liblapack_LINUX.a for linking.
