PDL::LAPACK
-----------
This package is an additional perl PDL module for access to
fast linear algebra functions from the popular LAPACK math
package.

Currently only a few functions from LAPACK are reachable through
PDL::LAPACK. There are currently only the funtions available
which are needed by the author. We hope that future releases
will integrate more functions - especially the main 'driver 
functions' from LAPACK.

If you need special functions or like to submit a patch, please
contact the author.


Naming Convention
-----------------
Basically the names in PDL::LAPACK and LAPACK are the same.
Because we only use the double functions, the leading d is
omitted.

example:

LAPACK names     : dposv (double real), sposv (single real), cposv (complex)
PDL::LAPACK name : posv (based on the dposv function)


Installation
------------
Please read the file INSTALL for detailed information on how
to configure and install PDL::LAPACK.

Once you have built PDL::LAPACK and installed it along with PDL
the following use should work without errors:

use PDL;
use PDL::LAPACK;

Notes
-----
The optional subdirectory "LAPACK" should contain a compiled version
of the CLAPACK libraries with the corresponding header files. This
is only necessary if there is no global CLAPACK installation available.
In this case the directory should contain following files:

CLAPACK/blaswrap.h
CLAPACK/clapack.h
CLAPACK/f2c.h
CLAPACK/libF77.a
CLAPACK/libI77.a
CLAPACK/libcblaswr.a
CLAPACK/liblapack_LINUX.a
CLAPACK/tmglib_LINUX.a

The *_LINUX libraries may be named according to your architecture.
The lapack_LINUX.a should be renamed into liblapack_LINUX.a for linking.
